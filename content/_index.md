# Nick Klagge

This is a home for my personal work around the web.

## Programming

I do a lot of programming for work, but unfortunately I can't share it publicly. These are some personal projects.

- [Github](https://github.com/nklagge): Mostly R programming projects
- [Hungry City Map](https://nklagge.shinyapps.io/hcmap): An R Shiny app showing all the active restaurants reviewed in Ligaya Mishan's [Hungry City column](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hungry-city) in the New York Times

## Web Design

I built and maintain a couple of sites for family members (as well as this one), using Hugo and R `blogdown`. The source code is on my Github page:

- My partner's [professional website](https://elisecastillo.com)
- A website for [Kasaysayan San Jose](https://kasaysayan.netlify.com), a historical preservation project I started with my partner and her father

## Miscellaneous

- My [Goodreads page](http://goodreads.com/klagge)
- [The Romp](http://theromp.tumblr.com/), an infrequently updated music Tumblr
